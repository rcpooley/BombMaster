## Developer - first time setup

### Frontend

```
npm i
```

Note there was an error installing core-js, to solve I removed parcel-bundler dependency in package.json, ran `npm i`, readded parcel-bundler, ran `npm i` again, and that time it succeeded

### Backend

```
cd Backend
npm i
cd ..
```

### Run in production

```
node Backend/server.js
```
